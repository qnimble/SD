sentence=Arduino SD compatibility layer for SdFat.
paragraph=Fork of PaulStoffregen's SD library to add support for Quarto. To access SD cards, we now use Bill Greiman's SdFat library.  This library just provides a thin wrapper so programs written for Arduino's SD library can use SdFat.  None of the original Arduino SD library code is present in this compatibility library.
